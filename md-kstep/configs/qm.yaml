# QM trajectory configuration for xTB
temperature_K: 300.0
friction_per_ps: 0.002  # Lower friction for QM (more realistic dynamics)
dt_fs: 0.25  # QM-appropriate timestep (much smaller than MM's 2 fs)
length_ps: 30.0  # Shorter than MM (QM is expensive) - aim for 30-50 ps
save_interval_steps: 1  # Save every step for dense supervision
method: GFN2-xTB  # xTB method (GFN2-xTB is most accurate)
random_seed: 42
charge: 0  # Neutral molecules only for PoC
spin_multiplicity: 1  # Singlets only for PoC
equilibration_ps: 5.0  # Short equilibration before production
nve_window_ps: 10.0  # NVE windows for energy conservation analysis
nve_every_ps: 20.0  # Run NVE window every 20 ps
